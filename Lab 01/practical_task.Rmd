## Introduction

For performing practical tasks **R** and **R Studio** have to be installed.

Links for downloading programs:

1.  R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>.

2.  RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

3.  Git: <https://git-scm.com/> (optional, if you want to push and pull changes to Github from RStudio).

The results of laboratory work must be placed in your repository on Github in the files `LabX.Rmd` (or `LabX.qmd` if you prefer to use quarto) and generated from it `LabX.html`, where X is the number of the laboratory in the form: **question**, **code**, **result** (if necessary). So, the file structure could looks like:

```         
--ComputerSupportSTU
  |--Lab1.Rmd
  |--Lab1.html
```

Example of output:

1.  Print rownames of dataset `mtcars`.

```{r}
row.names(mtcars)
```

## Task 0

1.  Create Github accout
2.  Create new repository "ComputerSupportSTU"
3.  In readme.md file add title a short repository description

## Task 1

1.  Create variables with all atomic types. Atomic types: `character`, `numeric`, `integer`, `complex`, `logical`.

2.  Create the next vectors:

-   sequence from 5 to 75;
-   numbers: 3.14, 2.71, 0, 13;
-   with 100 `TRUE` values.

3.  Create the next matrix:

|     |       |     |
|:---:|:-----:|:---:|
| 12  |  34   | 87  |
| -12 | -12.1 |  0  |
| 3.6 |  0.5  | 1.3 |

4.  Create a `list` with all atomic types.

5.  Create a `factor` with 3 levels: `infant`, `child`, `adult`.

6.  Create a `data frame`

7.  Change column names of the `data frame`.

## Task 2

## Task 1. Exploraring a dataset

For this task you have to use dataset from file `airquality.csv`. The description of the data you can find by the [link](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/airquality).

Example, how to work with the dataset. For instanse, we want to find month (column `Month`) with highest mean temperature (`Temp`)

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

airquality |> 
  group_by(Month) |> 
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(Temp)) |> 
  filter(mean_temp == max(mean_temp))
```

You task is to answer the following questions about this data by writing appropriate code.

1.  What are the column names of the data frame?

2.  What are the row names of the data frame?

3.  Extract the first 6 rows of the data frame and print them to the console

4.  How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

5.  Extract the last 6 rows of the data frame and print them to the console

6.  How many missing values are in the "Ozone" column of this data frame?

7.  What is the mean of the "Ozone" column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

8.  Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90.
